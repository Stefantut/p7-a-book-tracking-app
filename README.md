@2018 - Udacity - FrontEnd Web Developer NanoDegree

# About
A book shelf App that allows user to select and categorize books.

## Installing
* In your root folder -> Run `npm install` to install npm.
* To start your app -> Run `npm start`.
* Automatically a new tab will open in your browser -> `localhost:3000`.

### Functionality
The main page contains three shelves:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

#### Adding a book to the shelf
* To access the search page select the plus icon located at the bottom right of the page. Type in the search field for possible books to be found. No results will be displayed if the input field is blank or the query you've typed does not exist.

* The process of adding a book to a shelf is identical to the process described in the previous section. Once the option is selected the book will be displayed on the selected shelf on the main page of the application.

* To return to the main page you may use the back arrow in the input area at the top or the browsers back arrow.
